# DataStructuresAndSoftwareEngineeringPortfolio
This is my collection of projects to demonstrate my understanding and usage of several data structures. It primarily consists of my schoolwork from colllege. 

NOTE: USING THIS CODE FOR CLASS PROJECTS FOR THE CLASSES LISTED BELOW IS A VIOLATION OF THE HONOR CODE. WE WILL BOTH GET IN TROUBLE FOR SUCH USAGE. YOU WILL GET CAUGHT, THEY LITERALLY ADDED THE CODE TO A CHEATING DATABASE AS A PART OF THE AUTOGRADER SUBMISSIONS !!!!!! It is not worth it, just go to office hours instead or the ECAS center in the Chrysler center. 


Classes the work is from:

  CIS 125 programming logic
  
  CIS 130 Intro to C# 
  
  EECS 280
  
  EECS 281
  
  EECS 370
