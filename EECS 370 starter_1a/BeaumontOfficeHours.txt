bitwise ops for translating cmds

combining all binary pieces into one line 

1. shift a by << n(number of spaces needed to be shifted over left) to make room for the other binary number 
2. use bitwise or to combine a and b 
3. repeat 


question: data rep of the binary to be shifted ??? 
int apparently, for n tick define like the max length 


atoi to convert for registers 
just set a variable to decimal number for opcode value 

2's compliment 

positive version of binary 
then flip it aka all 0->1 1->0
then plus 1 


no need to implement 2's compliment 

need to use bitmasking to get the 16 bits max needed though for the 2's compliment!! 

zero out the not needed stuff

use a bitwise and on the ones you want to keep,  just all ones at the end 

declare the max number of 16 bits, then perform a bitwise and between the offset and the max 

note about the max: rep it as a hex number , just in, dont forget the 0x, 0b is for binary
