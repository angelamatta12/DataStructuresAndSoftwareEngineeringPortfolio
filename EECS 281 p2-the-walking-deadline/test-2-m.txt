# sample 2, doesn't start at round 1, therefore printing for median shouldnt start until round 5 and could possibly have a problem with testing whether or not the win 
# win condition/lose condition was actually found 
# could possibly read input in incorrectly, not getting the correct numbers or something if it does not account for comments 
# also distance could be 0 to start with for the max so needs to get the right distance/zombie it lost to
